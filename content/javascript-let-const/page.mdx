# Understanding the basics

JavaScript provides two important keywords for variable declaration: `let` and `const`. In this blog post, we will explore the differences between them and when to use each one.

## let Keyword

The `let` keyword allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression in which they are used. This is unlike the `var` keyword, which defines a variable globally or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

```javascript {1, 3}
let x = 10;
if (x === 10) {
  let y = 20;
  console.log(y); // 20
}
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

In the above example, `y` is only accessible within the `if` block.

## const Keyword

The `const` keyword is used to declare variables that are read-only. This means that once a value is assigned to a `const` variable, it cannot be reassigned. However, it does not mean the value itself is immutable.

```javascript
const z = 30;
z = 40; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

In the above example, trying to reassign `z` will result in a TypeError.

# Highlighting differences

- `let` allows reassigning the variable, while `const` does not.
- Both `let` and `const` are block-scoped, unlike `var`.
- `const` variables must be initialized when declared.

```javascript {2, 5}
let a = 10;
a = 20; // OK

const b = 30;
b = 40; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

# When to use `let` and `const`

Use `let` when you need to reassign a variable, and use `const` when you want to ensure the variable cannot be reassigned.

```javascript
let count = 0; // Use let when the value can change
const pi = 3.14159; // Use const for constants
```

# Conclusion

Understanding the differences between `let` and `const` is crucial for writing clean and maintainable JavaScript code. Use `let` when you need to reassign a variable, and use `const` when you want to ensure the variable cannot be reassigned.

Happy coding!

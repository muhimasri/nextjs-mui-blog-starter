# Understanding the basics

React provides a powerful hook called `useState` for managing state in functional components. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `useState` and some common patterns.

## useState Hook

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.

```javascript {1, 3}
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above example, `count` is the state variable, and `setCount` is the function to update it. Try the interactive example below:

<Counter />

## Initial State

You can pass an initial state value to `useState`. This value will be used as the initial state for the variable.

```javascript
const [name, setName] = useState("John Doe");
```

In the above example, `name` is initialized with the value `'John Doe'`.

# Updating State

To update the state, call the state update function with the new value. React will re-render the component with the updated state.

```javascript {4, 7}
const [age, setAge] = useState(25);

function increaseAge() {
  setAge(age + 1);
}
```

In the above example, calling `increaseAge` will update the `age` state and re-render the component.

# Common Patterns

- **Toggling State:** Use `useState` to toggle boolean values.

```javascript
const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);

function toggleVisibility() {
  setIsVisible(!isVisible);
}
```

- **Using Previous State:** When updating state based on the previous state, use a function.

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

function increment() {
  setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
}
```

# Conclusion

Understanding how to use the `useState` hook is essential for managing state in React functional components. It allows you to add stateful logic to your components in a clean and concise way.

Happy coding!

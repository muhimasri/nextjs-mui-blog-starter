# Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post! In this post, I will share my journey of learning Next.js and Material UI. Stay tuned for more exciting content!

## Learning Next.js

Let's start by learning Next.js!

### Why Next.js?

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. It provides a great developer experience with features like file-based routing, API routes, and built-in CSS support.

### Getting Started

To get started, we will install the latest Next.js version and create a new project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-mui-blog-starter
```

# Learning Material UI

## Why Material UI?

Material UI is a popular React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design. It provides a set of reusable components that can be customized to fit your design needs.

## Getting Started

To get started, we will install Material UI and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/material-nextjs @emotion/cache
```

# Code Highlighting

Code highlighting is an essential feature for technical blogs that include code snippets. It helps readers distinguish between code and text, understand the code structure, and identify keywords and syntax.

Here is an example of a code block with syntax highlighting:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount((prevCount) => prevCount - 1);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Counter />

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have set up a blog and portfolio website using Next.js and Material UI. We have also added dynamic routing, frontmatter, and a Table of Contents (TOC) to enhance the functionality of our blog. Stay tuned for more exciting content!

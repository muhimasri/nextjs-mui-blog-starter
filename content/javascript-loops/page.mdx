# Understanding the basics

JavaScript provides several ways to iterate over data structures. In this blog post, we will explore different types of loops and when to use each one.

## for Loop

The `for` loop is the most commonly used loop in JavaScript. It has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

```javascript {1, 3, 5}
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

In the above example, the loop runs five times, logging the values from 0 to 4.

## while Loop

The `while` loop continues to execute as long as the specified condition is true.

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
}
```

In the above example, the loop runs while `i` is less than 5.

## do...while Loop

The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

In the above example, the loop runs at least once and continues while `i` is less than 5.

# Highlighting differences

- `for` loop is best when the number of iterations is known.
- `while` loop is useful when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.
- `do...while` loop ensures the code block runs at least once.

```javascript {1, 6, 11}
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2
}

let j = 0;
while (j < 3) {
  console.log(j); // 0, 1, 2
  j++;
}

let k = 0;
do {
  console.log(k); // 0, 1, 2
  k++;
} while (k < 3);
```

# When to use different loops

Use `for` loop when you know the exact number of iterations. Use `while` loop when the number of iterations depends on a condition. Use `do...while` loop when you need to ensure the code block runs at least once.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i); // Use for loop for known iterations
}

let condition = true;
while (condition) {
  // Use while loop for condition-based iterations
  condition = false;
}

do {
  // Use do...while loop to run code at least once
} while (false);
```

# Conclusion

Understanding the differences between various loops in JavaScript is crucial for writing efficient and readable code. Use the appropriate loop based on your specific needs.

Happy coding!

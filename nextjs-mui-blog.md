# Introduction

In this tutorial, I will walk you through how to create a blog and portfolio website using Next.js and Material UI. This project is a lightweight, SEO-friendly, and highly customizable template that features dark mode support, token-based theming, a dynamic Table of Contents (TOC), code highlighting, and performance optimizations to achieve 90-100% Lighthouse scores.

# Setup

To get started we will install the latest Next.js version and create a new project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-mui-blog-starter
```

When the installation starts, you will be prompted with a few questions. You can choose the default settings or customize them to your liking as long as you exlcude Tailwind CSS as we will be using Material UI for styling.

After the installation is complete, navigate to the project and run the following command to start and test the project:

```bash
cd nextjs-mui-blog-starter
npm run dev
```

We should now see the default Next.js landing page.
